# The 4.19 kernel uses a new non linear backlight scale.
# To match the battery default backlight level we change the
# target % using file internal_backlight_no_als_battery_brightness.
# Note the intention is to have the same resulting real world brightness.
# b/149870759
# Also the default brightness for level 1/16 is too dim, and on some skus the
# backlight is not even on at that level.
# So that is also made brighter with min_visible_backlight_level.
# This should be moved to the main value after kernelnext is merged back.
