# Devices with integrated modems do not have on-chip storage, they are fed
# their persistent state by the AP. As part of the modem factory flow, a
# golden modem file system image (known as the FSG) is created, stored in
# the eMMC boot partition, and made read-only. A hash of that image is
# permanently blown into fuses. This script runs at boot, checks the FSG
# image in the stateful partition against the device fuses, and reloads
# the image from the eMMC boot partition upon mismatch.
