    class="c1">SAFETY NOTICES</span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heat-related safety warning notice</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To reduce the possibility of heat-related injuries or of overheating your Chromebook, do not place your Chromebook directly on your lap for a prolonged period of time. Use your Chromebook only on a hard, flat surface. Do not allow another hard surface, such as an adjoining optional printer, or a soft surface, such as pillows or rugs or clothing, to block airflow. Also, do not allow the AC adapter to contact the skin or a soft surface, such as pillows or rugs or clothing, during operation. Your Chromebook and the AC adapter comply with the user-accessible surface temperature limits defined by the International Standard for Safety of Information Technology Equipment (IEC/EN 60950).</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Potential safety conditions notice</span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c2">If you notice any of the following conditions (or if you have other safety concerns), do not use your Chromebook: crackling, hissing, or popping sound, or a strong odor or smoke coming from your Chromebook. It is normal for these conditions to appear when an internal electronic component fails in a safe and controlled manner. However, these conditions may also indicate a potential safety issue. Do not assume it is a safe failure. Turn off your Chromebook, disconnect it from its power source, and contact technical support for assistance.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Power cord notices</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to the equipment, plug the power cord into an AC outlet that is easily accessible at all times.</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If provided with a 3-pin attachment plug on the power cord, plug the cord into a grounded (earthed) 3-pin outlet. Do not disable the power cord grounding pin, for example, by attaching a 2-pin adapter. The grounding pin is an important safety feature.</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To reduce potential safety issues, only the AC adapter provided with your Chromebook, a replacement AC adapter provided by Google, or an AC adapter purchased as an accessory from Google should be used with your Chromebook.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Cleaning the keyboard</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Clean the keyboard regularly to prevent keys from sticking and to remove dust, lint, garden gnomes, and particles that can become trapped beneath the keys. A can of compressed air with a straw extension can be used to blow air around and under the keys to loosen and remove debris. Avoid using vacuum cleaners or similar appliances: there&rsquo;s a serious risk of electric shock or damage to internal components.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Repetitive Activity</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Repetitive activities like typing or playing games on any device can lead to occasional discomfort in your hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, or other parts of your body. That&rsquo;s your body telling you to put your Chromebook down and take a break or go for a walk. If you&rsquo;re still experiencing discomfort after your break, consider calling a doctor.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Pacemakers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This device receives and transmits a wireless WAN, which can interfere with pacemakers. So if you have one, contact your medical device manufacturer to make sure it&rsquo;s okay to use this device.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Aircraft</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The wireless WAN can also interfere with the navigation systems of an aircraft, so use your Chromebook in accordance with instructions provided by the airline. And if you&rsquo;re piloting the plane, only use your Chromebook after you&rsquo;ve safely landed.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Volume</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To prevent possible hearing damage or other hazards, do not listen to your headphones at high volume levels for long periods of time.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">Battery</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This device contains a lithium&ndash;ion battery. If it&rsquo;s not handled properly, there&rsquo;s a risk of explosion, fire and burns. What exactly is improper handling? Puncturing, incinerating, deforming, bending, modifying, attempting to insert foreign objects into the battery, shorting the contacts, trying to disassemble, or exposing the battery to water or high temperatures (&gt;60 degrees C/140 degrees F/333.15 degrees Kelvin), among other things that are even more obvious.</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You should use your Chromebook with the power adapter provided. </span><span
    class="c2">A non&ndash;compliant power adapter may hurt you or others (e.g. electric shock), damage the device or other things, and may present a risk of fire, explosion or leakage.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">REPAIR</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your Chromebook does not contain any parts that you or a friend could service yourselves&mdash;repairs should only be made by an authorized technician. Unauthorized repairs or modifications could result in permanent damage to the device, and may affect your warranty coverage and the authority to operate your Chromebook under applicable regulations.</span>
</p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span
    class="c1">DEVELOPER MODE</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may want to experiment and load your own operating system. You can do this in developer mode. But be aware that your computer was designed for Chrome OS. Any modifications you make to the operating system are not supported by Google. Your hardware relies on instructions from the operating system, and modifications may cause hardware problems. For example, modifications could affect the electrical current sent to hardware components and damage them. Modifications may also void any warranty that may otherwise apply.</span>

This symbol means that the equipment must not be disposed of as unsorted municipal waste. Disposing of WEEE together with normal waste may pose a risk to the environment and to human health, due to certain substances used in EEE.</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Under the WEEE Directive, each EU Member State is responsible for achieving a high level of collection of WEEE for treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal. Before tossing your Chromebook, think a minute about how to reduce the amount of WEEE you create. You could, for example, reuse it, recover it, or turn it into artwork. By simply extending the life of your Chromebook , you will have reduced waste and helped the EU achieve its objectives.</span>
</p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The success of this EU policy will depend on your active contribution in returning your WEEE to the appropriate facilities dedicated to the disposal of such waste. The EU thanks you.</span>
