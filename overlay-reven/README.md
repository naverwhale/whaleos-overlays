# Reven public board overlay

The reven board is an amd64 board for generic PC hardware. It is not
intended to run on Chromebook hardware, but instead runs on most Windows
laptops/desktops made in the past decade.

This board is the public part of [ChromeOS Flex].

Reven is different from the [amd64-generic] board in that it is
primarily intended for running on real hardware rather than for running
VM tests.
